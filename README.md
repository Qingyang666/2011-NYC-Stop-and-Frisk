## 2011 NYC SQF ANALYSIS

### Data Source
The link of NYC Stop, Question and Frisk Data is here(https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/stopfrisk.page). For each stop that was made by NYPD, the police officer should fill out a worksheet called Unified Form 250 to record the details of the stop. All the information in each year's data is coverted from the Unified Form 250, aka UF-250. In this project, we analyzed data in year 2011.
